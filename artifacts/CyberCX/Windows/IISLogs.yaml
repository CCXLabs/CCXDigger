  These logs record interaction with programs on a web server via the Internet Information Service (IIS). CCX Digger searches these logs for suspicious indicators associated with known threat actor activity, including interaction with 'known bad' IP addresses and use of suspicious command and tools.

      ## Summary

      Any results on this scan do not immediately indicate successful compromise of the web server. Some results may indicate attempted compromise, while some may also be false positives, especially IP addresses which may also have been legitimate connections. However all positive results should be reviewed further.

      Additional information about interpreting results from this detection are provided at the CCX Digger [wiki](https://github.com/CCXLabs/CCXDigger/wiki/Microsoft-IIS-Logs-%5B0.1%5D).
