description: |
  A [scheduled task](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2015/03/scheduled-tasks/) allows users to set commands to be executed at a specified time. These are often used by attackers to gain persistence on a system, either locally or across a network. A common attack technique also involves creating malicious tasks which execute Windows [batch files](https://fileinfo.com/extension/bat).

precondition: SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'

parameters:
  - name: SuspiciousScheduledTaskRegex
    default: "\\.bat$"

sources:
 - query: |
     SELECT *, upload(file=Command) AS Upload
     FROM Artifact.Windows.System.TaskScheduler()
     WHERE Command =~ ".bat$"

reports:
  - type: CLIENT
    template: |
      # Suspicious Scheduled Tasks

      {{ .Description }}

      {{ $rows := Query "SELECT * FROM source() \
                         LIMIT 1" | Expand }}

      {{ if $rows }}

      ## Summary

      A suspicious scheduled task was found, which executes a batch file, as indicated in the parameter "Command". This should be inspected further to determine whether it is malicious, including checking the metadata of the scheduled task, the location and metadata of the batch file, and the commands it runs.
