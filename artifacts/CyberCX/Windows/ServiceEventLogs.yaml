  Services are an inbuilt Windows feature which allow programs to run on computers between restarts. They are often abused by malware to persist between computer restarts. This artifact searches for a service previously created to run the Windows Command Prompt. This activity is typical of many post-exploitation tools, including one known as smbexec.

      ## Summary

      The Windows System event log (`C:\Windows\System32\winevt\logs\System.evtx`) was searched for any events which would be indicative of services being created referring to the %COMSPEC% environment variable. At least one such event was identified. These services may no longer exist in the current environment but did at some point previously.

      This detection does not necessarily indicate compromise and may be a false positive. Particularly there is potential that this is administrative activity.

      If you need additional information about this detection or assistance with interpeting the results, please refer to our [Wiki](https://github.com/CCXLabs/CCXDigger/wiki/Windows-Service-Event-Logs-%5B0.1%5D).
