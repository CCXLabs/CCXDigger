description: |
  This search aims to identify potentially malicious files that may be indicative of a [webshell](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/web-shell-malware). Specifically, key words and phrases will be searched for across all files with extensions of .php, .txt, .py, .aspx, or .resx.
  More information about how to interpret the results of this search are available on our [wiki](https://github.com/CCXLabs/CCXDigger/wiki/Webshells-%5B0.1%5D).

     ### Summary

     Files in locations designated by the field “FileName” have been detected containing code associated with an extension of [.php](https://fileinfo.com/extension/php#:~:text=A%20PHP%20file%20is%20a,PHP%x20%28Hypertext%20Preprocessor%29%20code.&text=The%20PHP%20code%20within%20the,to%20the%20user's%20web%20browser) and the characteristics of a [webshell](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/threats/web-shell-malware). This type of webshell is capable of running commands passed to it by an attacker via their browser.

     ### Summary

     This detection was triggered by a search for a script used to gather information about a computer and send it to a remote server. This script is written in a language called Perl. This program isn't a webshell but may be run by one for reconnoissance.

       <div class="collapse row"><div class="card card-body overflow-auto">

     ### Summary

     This detection was triggered by a search for a basic webshell containing encoded malware which has been heavily obfuscated.

     ## Malicious Resource File

       <div role="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-block row collapsible">View Details</div>
       <div class="collapse row"><div class="card card-body overflow-auto">

     ### Summary

     This detection was triggered by a search for a resource file containing encoded malware to be loaded by a webshell.

     Resource files, which typically have extensions of .resx, store data used by other programs created through the Microsoft .NET development toolkit. These other programs that use .resx files will typically be stored in files with file extensions of .vb, .vbs, .wsf, .aspx, or .asax.
